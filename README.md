# Movie Guessing Game

A simple movie-guessing game connecting to The Movie DB and Giphy APIs.

## Getting Started

Just open the index.html file and play!

Your task is to select (click) correct title of a movie (out of 4 possible answers), related to GIF below the page.

After your selection, you will be notified if you answer was correct or not.

You have 10 chances, after which game is reset.
